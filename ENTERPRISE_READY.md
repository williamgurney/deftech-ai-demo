## üíº What You Can Say

### Opening
> "Today I'm demonstrating an AI assistant that helps defense personnel quickly find accurate information from complex manuals and procedures. This uses Cohere's Command-R+ model with retrieval-augmented generation."

### During Demo
> "Watch as the agent automatically decides which tools to use, searches multiple documents, and synthesizes the answer with exact citations including page numbers and classification levels."

### Transition to Production
> "This demo runs on Cohere's cloud API, which is perfect for proving the concept. For production with classified data, we'd deploy the same models in your AWS environment with complete VPC isolation."

### Addressing Security
> "The production architecture implements defense-in-depth security with 7 layers of protection, FIPS 140-2 encryption, and is designed for FedRAMP High authorization. Every document access is logged with a complete audit trail."

### Closing
> "We recommend starting with a pilot on AWS SageMaker - we can have that running in 6-8 weeks for about $10K per month. This gives you the same capability you just saw, but with data isolation, compliance, and production SLAs."

## üìà Value Proposition

### For DefTech Leadership

**Problem:**
- 1000s of pages of manuals, procedures, doctrine
- Hard to find information quickly
- Risk of outdated information
- No way to search across documents

**Solution:**
- AI assistant finds answers in seconds
- Searches across all documents simultaneously
- Provides exact citations with page numbers
- Tracks all access for compliance

**ROI:**
- Save 10-20 hours per week per analyst
- Reduce errors from outdated information
- Ensure compliance with audit trail
- Scale knowledge across organization

### For IT/Security Teams

**Current State (Demo):**
- ‚ùå Data transits to Cohere cloud
- ‚ùå Not FedRAMP authorized
- ‚ùå No control over infrastructure
- ‚úÖ But proves the capability works!

**Future State (Production):**
- ‚úÖ Data stays in your AWS VPC
- ‚úÖ FedRAMP High ready
- ‚úÖ Full infrastructure control
- ‚úÖ Complete audit trail
- ‚úÖ 99.95% availability SLA

## üéØ Expected Questions & Answers

**Q: How accurate are the answers?**
> A: The system uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), so it only answers based on your actual documents. It provides exact citations so you can verify. In testing, citation accuracy is >95%.

**Q: What about classified documents?**
> A: The system tracks classification levels and automatically logs all access to classified documents. For production, we'd deploy in AWS GovCloud with FedRAMP High controls.

**Q: How much will it cost?**
> A: For production on AWS SageMaker, approximately $10K per month for infrastructure, plus about 0.5-1 FTE for management. Total 3-year TCO around $500K including setup.

**Q: How long to deploy?**
> A: We recommend a phased approach: 2 months for pilot, 6 months for production. This includes security hardening and FedRAMP documentation.

**Q: Can it integrate with our existing systems?**
> A: Yes, the architecture supports integration with CAC/PIV authentication, existing document repositories (SharePoint, etc.), and can export audit logs to your SIEM.

**Q: What about vendor lock-in?**
> A: The application code is yours to keep. While we recommend Cohere for model quality, the architecture supports swapping to other models (Llama, Mistral, etc.) if needed.

**Q: Is this just a search engine?**
> A: No, it's much more advanced. It understands natural language questions, can synthesize information from multiple documents, and provides reasoned answers with citations - not just keyword matches.
