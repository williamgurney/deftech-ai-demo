## Getting Started

### Quick Start (5 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Set API key
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add COHERE_API_KEY

# 3. Run automated setup
./setup_demo.sh

# 4. Run demo
python demo_queries.py
```

### Or Use Automated Setup

```bash
./setup_demo.sh
# Follow prompts to add API key
# Script handles everything else
```

## What to Show in Presentation

### 1. Architecture (5 min)
- Diagram: Query → Agent → Tools → Vector DB → Response
- Explain RAG pattern and tool use

### 2. Code Walkthrough (7 min)
- Tool schemas in `tools.py` (lines 150-250)
- Agent loop in `agent.py` (lines 35-80)
- System message in `config.py`

### 3. Live Demo (10 min)
- Run all 4 queries in `demo_queries.py`
- Show audit logs updating in real-time
- Point out: citations, tool calls, multi-step reasoning

### 4. Q&A (5-10 min)
- See PRESENTATION_GUIDE.md for common questions

## Key Differentiators (Cohere-Specific)

1. **Enterprise Focus** - Production-ready with flexible deployment
2. **Built-in Citations** - Native support for source attribution
3. **Multi-Step Tool Use** - Not just function calling, true agentic reasoning
4. **Embed v3** - State-of-the-art embeddings
5. **RAG Expertise** - Cohere pioneered many RAG techniques

## Production Readiness

### What's Production-Ready
- ✅ Core RAG architecture
- ✅ Tool use pattern
- ✅ Citation system
- ✅ Audit logging structure

### What Would Need Enhancement for Production
- ⚠️ User authentication and access control
- ⚠️ Database-backed audit logs (currently file-based)
- ⚠️ Production Qdrant cluster (currently local)
- ⚠️ Document security and encryption
- ⚠️ Rate limiting and error handling
- ⚠️ Monitoring and observability
- ⚠️ Scalability testing

## Performance Characteristics

### Ingestion
- ~4 documents (50 pages): 30 seconds
- Bottleneck: Embedding API calls (can be parallelized)

### Query
- Simple query: 3-5 seconds
- Multi-document query: 5-8 seconds
- Depends on: network latency, number of tool calls

### Scalability
- Current: Handles 100s of documents easily
- With production Qdrant: Millions of documents
- Vector search is sub-second even at scale

## Cost Estimates (Approximate)

### Per Demo Run (4 queries)
- Embeddings: ~$0.01 (one-time for ingestion)
- Chat API: ~$0.10-0.20 (varies by query complexity)
- Total: <$0.25 per full demo

### Monthly (100 queries/day)
- ~$600-900/month
- Could optimize with caching and batching

## Known Limitations

1. **Document Formats**: Only PDF and DOCX (could extend)
2. **Chunking**: Simple word-based (could use semantic chunking)
3. **No Reranking**: Could add Cohere's rerank for better results
4. **Local Only**: Requires network for Cohere API
5. **Demo Scale**: 4 sample documents (production would have 100s-1000s)

## Extension Ideas

### Easy Extensions
- Add more document formats (TXT, HTML, Markdown)
- Implement Cohere reranking for better search
- Add document update/versioning
- Web UI using Streamlit (basic framework included)

### Advanced Extensions
- Multi-modal (images in documents)
- Conversation history for follow-up questions
- User feedback loop for improving results
- Integration with existing defense systems
- Fine-tuning embeddings on domain-specific data
